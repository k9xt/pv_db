Better English Titles & Lyrics for Project DIVA f

This is meant to be installed to the USA version of the game.
Simply download pv_db.txt from this folder and overwrite the existing one in your game with the new one.

Status: 
        - Work in Progress (not all songs complete)
        - Please refrain from using until the mod is complete

Known issues:
              - Song titles & artists, even if changed in pv_db, will not be changed on the song start screen (where you set button sfx)
                due to the fact that the text there is a static image. You can replace them yourself if you want.
              - Some lyrics may be cut off or overlap with other elements due to the game's ui limitations.
